### About
Localfy is a simple web application for music fans who are tired of switching between apps to view concert listings and hear samples of an artist's music.

### Features
- Search for concerts by city.
- View concert details in the form of "cards" that contain time of the event, venue information, links to artists' spotify pages, links to purchase tickets and, 30 second previews of artists' top tracks.

### Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

The [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and the [Bandsintown API](http://www.bandsintown.com/api/overview) were used in Localfy.

### Future development
- Better search functionality such as searching by:
  - artist
  - venue
  - radius
- Sorting and filtering capabilities such as by:
  - artist
  - venue
  - radius
  - specific dates
- Favoriting/bookmarking a concert to view later.
