# Localfy
Localfy is a simple web application for music fans who are tired of switching between apps to view concert listings and hear samples of an artist's music. 

#### Features
Localfy allows you to search for concerts by location, providing concert details such as the time of the event, venue information, links to artists' spotify pages, links to purchase tickets and, 30 second previews of artists' top tracks.

#### Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap were used for Localfy.

APIs used were the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and the [Bandsintown API](http://www.bandsintown.com/api/overview).

#### Future development
In the future, I would like to add advanced search functionality such as searching by artist name.
